# Welcome to the React Applicaiton Page!

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive, dynamic, and powerful interface for the Stemmons Application Product.

The project is composed of many modular coponents.

## Overview
 The future plan is to create more sections for the page and to have
the user toggle which ones they want on or off.
The overview page currently contains 3 distinct sections.
* Visuals
* Items
* People

## Main:
 ![Overview Page](ApplicationPage\docs\imgs\overview.PNG)

### Visuals
At some point this will need to be extremely interactive in the future. What that means needs to be determined. Do clicks lead to the cases? Open other Visuals? Other Applications?

![Overview Visuals](docs\imgs\overview_visuals.PNG)

### Items
This currently runs off of the STTUS, CATEG system codes as well a a general cumulative count.
There was a request for TYPE system code but there was no data for that, so we did not implement.

![Overview Items](docs\imgs\overview_items.PNG)

### People
At the moment this contains ALL people and is click-able. This will bring open a pop-up with click-able number that will nead to those actual cases.

## Cases/Tasks
There are two distinct high level components here, view tasks and create tasks.

### View Tasks
This component is composed of two* other components
![Tasks Main](docs\imgs\tasks_page.PNG)

Tasks lists, shows all cases for a specific context.
