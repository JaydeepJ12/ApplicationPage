# Welcome to the React Applicaiton Page!

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive, dynamic, and powerful interface for the Stemmons Application Product.

The project is composed of many modular coponents.

## Overview
 The future plan is to create more sections for the page and to have
the user toggle which ones they want on or off.
The overview page currently contains 3 distinct sections.
* Visuals
* Items
* People

## Main:

### Visuals
At some point this will need to be extremely interactive in the future. What that means needs to be determined. Do clicks lead to the cases? Open other Visuals? Other Applications?

### Items
This currently runs off of the STTUS, CATEG system codes as well a a general cumulative count.
There was a request for TYPE system code but there was no data for that, so we did not implement.
